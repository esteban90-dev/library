# Library 

This app is the [Library Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/library) from 
[The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/).

The app allows users to add and remove books from the library, and change the read status of books in the library.  Localstorage support was added to persist the library
between browser sessions.  This was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  A live version can be found [here](https://esteban90-dev.github.io/library/).
